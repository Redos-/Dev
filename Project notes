TO DO:
1. Player movement like in crimsonland
2. Proper player diplay behind and over sprites
3. Collision with object
4. FPS Counter 
(+) 5. "Weird" picture blinking - Fixed by zooming to 0.25, looks like its somehow because of image sizes
6. Occasional "jittering" during camera movement
7. Occasional "stuttering" of specific tiles during camera movement
